# Keep profiles.json if needed, or ignore it if it's user-specific. 
# User wanted "Material presets" to exist by default. If we seed them, we might want to track a default file, 
# or just let the API seed it. The API seeds data/profiles.json if missing. 
# We probably want to ignore USER CHANGES to profiles.json but how to keep defaults?
# The API "seeds" it from code constants. So we can ignore profiles.json too if we want a fresh start.
# BUT earlier users wanted defaults tracked?
# The request was: "only material presets should exist in the app and repo by default".
# If I git-ignore profiles.json, the repo won't have it.
# If I track profiles.json, it will have defaults.
# I will ignore *.json in data/spools/ but KEEP data/profiles.json if it exists, or maybe ignore it and rely on seeding.
# The user said: "only material presets should exist in the app AND REPO by default".
# So profiles.json SHOULD be in the repo? 
# OR the "code" contains the presets.
# Code says: "DEFAULT_PROFILES" const in route.ts writes to file if missing.
# So we can safely ignore data/profiles.json, and the app will generate it on startup.
# This ensures "Repo is clean".
# I'll check if I should ignore profiles.json. "Clear the repo of any files that are not required".
# If the app generates it, it's not required.

# Ignore all JSON in data, except maybe if we want to config database explicitly?
# I'll ignore specific patterns
data/spools/*.json

data/users.json
